Here lies my neovim configuration. I previously tried to use **nix** to config my neovim.

However, since my neovim configuration was changing constantly, using nix - an immutable system - feels like a pain in the ass. So here we are.

I will still use nix to install my language packages, and language servers instead of using Mason to manage those, so check out my nix configuration [here](https://github.com/qmi03/dotfiles/blob/master/modules/common/packages/configs/neovim/default.nix)
